## 🧠 From Code to Strategy: My Journey Building Blockchain Platforms for Enterprises

Over the last 7+ years, I’ve been fortunate to work at the intersection of **engineering, emerging technologies, and product strategy**. My journey began with a fascination for **distributed systems** and evolved into leading end-to-end delivery of **blockchain-based platforms** in tax compliance, identity, and telecom.

This post is a reflection on that journey — from **writing smart contracts and Go services** to **steering platform direction** as an AVP of Product.

### 🚀 Starting with Code: Smart Contracts, APIs, and Systems Thinking

In 2018, I joined KrypC as a **Blockchain Developer**, where I dove deep into:

- Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum
- Chaincode design and access control patterns
- Cryptographic primitives, key management, and secure API layers

I learned that building blockchain systems wasn't about writing flashy code — it was about **designing trust**, **data flow integrity**, and **organizational collaboration**.

### 🔄 Growing into Systems and Product Alignment

As a **Senior Software Engineer**, I moved beyond implementation and started shaping:

- How features were scoped from client workshops
- How backend systems could scale across cloud platforms
- How infrastructure decisions impacted speed, security, and costs

This phase taught me the importance of **cross-functional empathy** — understanding DevOps, QA, product goals, and even legal constraints when building enterprise systems.

### 🧭 Strategic Delivery: Bridging Product Vision and Execution

As AVP – Products, I began leading full platform cycles:

- Defined product roadmaps aligned with client value (Siemens, Vertex, Cofra)
- Drove go-to-market planning for Taxchain and Digi Credentials
- Scaled cross-functional teams and coordinated delivery using Agile methods
- Balanced stakeholder expectations while still owning architectural decisions

One of my proudest moments was leading the transformation of **Taxchain** into a scalable blockchain compliance product that was **acquired and adopted by global clients**.

### 🎓 Reinventing Myself: MBA + Product + AI

To stay future-ready, I’m currently pursuing an **MBA in AI for Business at BITS Pilani**. My goal is to deepen my product mindset, explore data-driven leadership, and blend AI with blockchain in ways that bring real-world impact.

### 🔍 Looking Ahead

I’m passionate about building things that **scale, endure, and matter** — especially at the convergence of **AI, product design, and engineering**. I'm open to meaningful conversations around:

- Product leadership in AI/blockchain/SaaS
- Strategic transformation of digital platforms
- Mentorship and collaboration
